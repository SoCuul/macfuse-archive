# Name

**fuse-archive** - Mount an archive or compressed file as a FUSE file system.

# Synopsis

**fuse-archive** [*options*] *archive-file* [*mount-point*]

# Description

**fuse-archive** is a program that serves an archive or compressed file (e.g.
`foo.tar`, `foo.tar.gz`, `foo.xz` or `foo.zip`) as a read-only
[FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) file system.

It is similar to [**mount-zip**](https://github.com/google/mount-zip) and
[**fuse-zip**](https://bitbucket.org/agalanin/fuse-zip) but speaks a larger
range of archive or compressed file formats.

It is similar to [**archivemount**](https://github.com/cybernoid/archivemount)
but can be much faster (see the Performance section below) although it can only
mount read-only, not read-write.

# Performance

Create a single `.tar.gz` file that is 256 MiB decompressed and 255 KiB
compressed (the file just contains repeated 0x00 NUL bytes):

```
$ truncate --size=256M zeroes
$ tar cfz zeroes-256mib.tar.gz zeroes
```

**fuse-archive** timings:

```
$ time fuse-archive zeroes-256mib.tar.gz mnt
real    0m0.443s

$ dd if=mnt/zeroes of=/dev/null status=progress
524288+0 records in
524288+0 records out
268435456 bytes (268 MB, 256 MiB) copied, 0.836048 s, 321 MB/s

$ fusermount -u mnt
```

**archivemount** timings:

```
$ time archivemount zeroes-256mib.tar.gz mnt
real    0m0.581s

$ dd if=mnt/zeroes of=/dev/null status=progress
268288512 bytes (268 MB, 256 MiB) copied, 569 s, 471 kB/s
524288+0 records in
524288+0 records out
268435456 bytes (268 MB, 256 MiB) copied, 570.146 s, 471 kB/s

$ fusermount -u mnt
```

Here, **fuse-archive** takes about the same time to scan the archive, bind the
mountpoint and daemonize, but it is **~700Ã— faster** (0.83s vs 570s) to copy out
the decompressed contents. This is because **fuse-archive** does not use
**archivemount**'s
[quadratic complexity algorithm](https://github.com/cybernoid/archivemount/issues/21).

# Return Value

**0**
:   Success.

**1**
:   Generic error code for: missing command line argument, too many command line
    arguments, unknown option, mount point is not empty, etc.

**10**
:   Cannot create the mount point.

**11**
:   Cannot open the archive file.

**12**
:   Cannot create the cache file.

**13**
:   Cannot write to the cache file. This is most likely the indication that
    there is not enough temp space.

**20**
:   The archive contains an encrypted file, but no password was provided.

**21**
:   The archive contains an encrypted file, and the provided password does not
    decrypt it.

**22**
:   The archive contains an encrypted file, and the encryption method is not
    supported.

**30**
:   Cannot recognize the archive format.

**31**
:   Invalid archive header.

**32**
:   Cannot read and extract the archive.
